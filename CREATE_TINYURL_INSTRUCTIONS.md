## 📝 Create Your TinyURL Now

I've opened TinyURL.com in the Simple Browser. Follow these steps:

### Step 1: Enter Your GitHub Pages URL
In the "Enter a long URL to make tiny" field, paste:
```
https://vinzy-98.github.io/eppp-practice-tests/
```

### Step 2: (Optional) Customize Your Link
- Click "Make TinyURL!"
- Or click "Customize your link" to choose a custom ending
  - Example: `tinyurl.com/eppp-practice` or `tinyurl.com/eppp2025`

### Step 3: Copy Your New Short URL
- TinyURL will give you a short link like: `https://tinyurl.com/abc123`
- Copy this link - this is what you'll share with users!

---

## 🎯 Why This Works for Privacy

✅ **Hides your GitHub username** - Users only see `tinyurl.com/...`
✅ **Can't trace back** - No way to know it's hosted on GitHub
✅ **Professional appearance** - Clean, simple link
✅ **Easy to share** - Short and memorable
✅ **No account needed** - Works instantly

## 📤 Share With Users

Once you have your TinyURL, share this message:

```
Access the EPPP Practice Tests:

URL: [YOUR TINYURL HERE]
Access Code: EPPP2025

Visit the URL and enter the access code when prompted.
Your progress will be saved automatically!
```

## 🔒 Security Benefits

1. **Hidden Repository**: Users can't find your GitHub repo
2. **No Source Access**: Can't view your code or structure
3. **Password Protected**: Even with URL, need EPPP2025 to access
4. **Session-Based**: Access expires when browser closes
5. **Admin Dashboard**: You can still track usage at the full URL
