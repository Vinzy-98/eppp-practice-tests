# 🔒 Admin Access - Private Repository

## ⚠️ Admin Dashboard Location

The admin dashboard and sensitive administrative files have been moved to a **private repository** for security.

### Admin Files Are Now In:

- **Access:** Private - only repository owner can access

### Files Moved to Private Repo:
- ✅ `admin.html` - Admin dashboard with user analytics
